Task 1: Linear Regression (PyTorch)

Implemented a linear regression model in PyTorch to predict median housing prices in California, with an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. The project includes exploratory data analysis, stratified train/validation/test splits to avoid data leakage, correlation analysis, data cleaning, and extensive feature engineering such as one-hot encoding, scaling, log transforms, ratio features, and RBF-based similarity features using pipelines. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent and evaluated using R², error distributions, and prediction visualizations. Additional experiments include 5-fold cross-validation, coefficient interpretation, L2-regularized regression, polynomial basis expansion, and a hyperparameter sweep to study the impact of regularization strength on generalization performance.
